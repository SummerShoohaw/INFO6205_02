# Genetic Algorithms to draw pictures

This application implements genetic algorithm to render pictures by simply using triangles.

##### This is the <a href="https://github.com/SummerShoohaw/INFO6205_202/blob/master/Report.pdf">REPORT</a> for the project

## How to run the application
  
  1). Choose some simple pictures such as chrome logo, firefox logo, pepsi logo or so forth as a target picture.
  
  2). Prepare the image. ATTENTION PLEASE!!!
  
   (a). Only `PNG` image is accepted.
              
   (b). make sure the `color model` is `32bit`.
              
   (c). name the png file as `test.png`.
              
   (d). dimensions better less than 200x200 (I would recommend 75x75).
  
  3). Pull the repository, copy the target picture to folder ```./INFO6205_02/GeneticAlgorithms/targetimg/```
  
  4). Open the project using Eclipse and run it, or you can simply run the ```MainClass``` under package ```GateWay```
  
  5). Get a cup of coffee, and wait for the result, result will be stored in ```./INFO6205_02/GeneticAlgorithms/outputimages/```
