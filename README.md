# Genetic Algorithms to draw pictures

This application implements genetic algorithm to render pictures by simply using triangles.

## How to run the application
  
  1). Choose some simple pictures such as chrome logo, firefox logo, pepsi logo or so forth as a target picture.
  
  2). Prepare the image according to above directions:<br>
  　　(a). Only _`PNG`_ image is accepted.<br>
  　　(b). make sure the picture is in `RGB color space with alpha channel`.<br>
  　　(c). name the png file as _`test.png`_.<br>
  　　(d). dimensions better less than 200x200 (I would recommend 75x75).<br>
  
  3). Pull the repository, copy the target picture to folder ```./INFO6205_02/GeneticAlgorithms/targetimg/```
  
  4). Open the project using Eclipse and run it, or you can simply run the ```MainClass``` under package ```GateWay```
  
  5). Get a cup of coffee, and wait for the result, result will be stored in ```./INFO6205_02/GeneticAlgorithms/outputimages/```
