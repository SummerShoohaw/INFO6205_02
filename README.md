# Genetic Algorithms to draw pictures

This application uses genetic algorithm that renders pictures by simply using triangles.

## How to run the application
  
  1). Prepare the target picture (only PNG image is accepted), make sure the color model is 32bit, and dimensions better less than 200x200
  
  2). Pull the repository, copy the target picture to folder ```./INFO6205_02/GeneticAlgorithms/targetimg/```
  
  3). Open the project using Eclipse and run it, or you can simply run the ```MainClass``` under package ```GateWay```
  
  4). Get a cup of coffee, and wait for the result, result will be stored in ```./INFO6205_02/GeneticAlgorithms/outputimages/```
